    "text": "Characteristics of the TCGA Database:\n\nRich Cancer Tissue Sample Data:\n\n\nThe TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database amasses a substantial volume of tissue sample data across a variety of cancer types, encompassing multi-dimensional data such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. This repository serves as a valuable resource for cancer research, enabling researchers to delve into the biological mechanisms of cancer at multiple levels.\n\n\nPrimary Focus on Cancer Types:\n\n\nThe core objective of TCGA is to unveil the molecular mechanisms, pathogenic genes, and mutation frequencies of different cancer types through integrative analysis, thereby providing a robust scientific basis for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer.\n\n\nLimited Quantity of Normal Tissue Samples:\n\n\nDespite the richness of cancer sample data, TCGA has a relatively limited number of normal tissue samples, which to some extent, restricts its application in comparative studies between normal and cancerous tissues."

This is crucial for understanding the heterogeneity of gene expression across different tissues and the functionality of genes under normal physiological conditions.\n\n\nFocus on Gene Expression Patterns in Normal Tissues:\n\n\nGTEx aims to reveal the patterns and variations of gene expression in normal tissues, providing a valuable foundation for researching gene functionality and regulatory mechanisms."

This may include data cleansing, standardization, and a unified analysis workflow to ensure that data obtained from different databases can be accurately and effectively combined for analysis."
