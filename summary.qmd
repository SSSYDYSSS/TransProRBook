# Summary

In summary, this book has no content whatsoever.

::: {.callout-note}
Polars works fine with Matplotlib, Plotly, and Altair, but it doesn't work with Seaborn, nor does it have its own `.plot` method. The latter two are very convenient
for exploratory data analysis, so for these examples we'll just use `to_pandas` followed by `plot` or a Seaborn function after doing all the data manipulation in Polars.
