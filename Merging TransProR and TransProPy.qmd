# Merging TransProR and TransProPy

## Innovation Point
::: {.callout-tip}
The <b style="color: #6a926b;">reasons</b> for <b style="color: #6a926b;">merging the two classes of methods</b> from the R package TransProR and the Python package TransProPy are as follows:
:::


::: {.callout-highlight}

> * **Complementarity:**
> 
> >Univariate methods are effective in identifying significant features, while multivariate methods excel in evaluating interactions between features. Combining the two allows for the simultaneous utilization of the advantages of both methods.
> 
> * **Reduction of Redundancy:** 
> 
> >By integrating multiple techniques, feature redundancy can be measured more accurately, allowing for the selection of effective feature combinations.
> 
> * **Enhanced Classification Ability:** 
> 
> >The mvAUC metric evaluates the global complementarity among feature combinations, aiding in the improvement of classification capabilities.
> 
> * **Comprehensive Consideration of Feature Performance:** 
> 
> >By combining techniques such as ensemble learning and recursive feature elimination, a more comprehensive consideration of feature performance within a predictive model framework can be Merging TransProR and TransProPyachieved.
